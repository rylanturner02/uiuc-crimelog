# uiuc-crimelog
Tracking Univ of Illinois' Daily Crime Log on a map.

This project is a small endeavor I'm taking on alone, with no larger goal or purpose in mind.
My website uses the OpenLayers API for mapping features, and UIUC's Daily Crime Log can be found at: https://police.illinois.edu/crime-reporting/daily-crime-log/

This repository was opened on November 1st, 2020.
