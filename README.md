Tracking Univ of Illinois' Daily Crime Log on a map.

This project is a small endeavor I'm taking on alone, with no larger goal or purpose in mind.
My website uses the OpenLayers API for mapping features, and UIUC's Daily Crime Log can be found at: https://police.illinois.edu/crime-reporting/daily-crime-log/

All the data presented is thanks in part to the University Police Department, and is solely used to present an unofficial log of police reports to the university. This repository was opened on November 1st, 2020.
